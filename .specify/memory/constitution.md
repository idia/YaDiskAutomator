# YaDiskAutomator Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Minimalism (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Code MUST perform only necessary functions. Nothing extra. Less is better. Fewer words, more action.

**Rules**:
- Every line of code must serve a clear, necessary purpose
- Remove any code that doesn't directly contribute to required functionality
- Prefer simple, direct solutions over complex abstractions
- Avoid premature optimization, unnecessary patterns, or "just in case" code
- Documentation only when essential for understanding

**Rationale**: Simplicity reduces bugs, improves maintainability, and accelerates delivery. Complexity is the enemy of reliability.

## Governance

All code changes MUST comply with the Minimalism principle. Code reviews must reject unnecessary complexity unless explicitly justified.

Amendments to this constitution require:
1. Clear justification for the change
2. Version increment per semantic versioning
3. Update of dependent templates if needed

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-01-27 | **Last Amended**: 2025-01-27
